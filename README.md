# M02-Lab_Case-Study

Write a Python app that will accept student names and GPAs and test if the student qualifies for either the Dean's List or the Honor Roll. Your app will:
ask for and accept a student's last name.

quit processing student records if the last name entered is 'ZZZ'.
ask for and accept a student's first name.
ask for and accept the student's GPA as a float.
test if the student's GPA is 3.5 or greater and, if so, print a message saying that the student has made the Dean's List.
test if the student's GPA is 3.25 or greater and, if so, print a message saying that the studnet has made the Honor Roll.

Test your app using at least five students.
